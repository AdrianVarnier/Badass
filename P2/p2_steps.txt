GOAL: DISCOVER VXLAN. ENABLE CONNECTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT MACHINES,
USING STATIC MULTICAST, THEN DYNAMIC MULTICAST.

1. Create the topology

2. Launch the machines and open the auxiliary terminals

3. Assign correct IP addresses to the hosts on the interface that connects to the router

4. Configure the routers according to whether you want static cast or multicast:
    - enters bash (ip -d show link doesn't work in busybox, neither does vxlan id 10)
    - create and set up a bridge 
    - create and set up vxlan interface with id 10
    - add the two interfaces (eth1 and vxlan) to the bridge

5. You can now test ping with wireshark.
