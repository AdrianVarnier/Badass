GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator) is a software that allows you to emulate networks with 
a graphical interface. You can use Docker images inside GNS3 to virtualise network devices.

AS (Autonomous System) is a cluster of networks that are under the same administrative control.

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a protocol, mainly used by Internet, that allows ASes to 
communicate with each other using optimised routing tables. The optimisation takes into account
length, origin and preferences in terms of routes.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a protocol, mainly used to manage communication inside ASes,
that relies upon an optimised algorithm to find the best link between a source and a destination,
based on multiple criteria such as bandwith, delay or cost.
