GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator) is a software that allows you to emulate networks with 
a graphical interface. You can use Docker images inside GNS3 to virtualise network devices.

AS (Autonomous System) is a cluster of networks that are under the same administrative control.

OSI Layer 2 (Data Link) defines the format of data on the network.
OSI Layer 3 (Network) decides which physical path the data will take.

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a protocol, mainly used by Internet, that allows ASes to 
communicate with each other using optimised routing tables. The optimisation takes into account
length, origin and preferences in terms of routes. BGP is an application (layer 7), however its
technology relies upon TCP (layer 4) and uses routing tables (layer 3).

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a protocol, mainly used to manage communication inside ASes,
that relies upon an optimised algorithm to find the best link between a source and a destination,
based on multiple criteria such as bandwith, delay or cost. OSPF uses IP protocol (layer 3)
and MAC addressing (layer 2).

A packet routing software breaks down data into "packets" and forward them properly from the
source to the chosen destination by choosing the most efficient path. It also does network traffic
control to regulate the flow of packets. Additionnally, it handles errors in case of corruption or
loss of data and provides an interface to filter packets.

We used Zebra as a routing engine service. It is a key component/software found inside the router
that is responsible for making routing decisions. It uses BGP and OSPF protocols.

Busybox is a shell in a single executable file that provides a limited number of commands. It uses 
less memory and resources than standard shells.

A LAN (Local Area Network) is a physical network.
A VLAN (Virtual LAN) is the virtual layer on top of the LAN that offers better routing
management by segmenting traffic and resources optimally. VLAN are restricted to 4096 which
prevents scalability for big data centres, for example.
VXLAN (Virtual Xtensible LAN) is a more scalable solution, as it uses layer 3 (IP addressing)
that allows for 16 million VXLANs, going way beyond the restrictions of VLANs (that use MAC 
addressing on layer 2). 

A switch is a networking device that simply transmits data between connected devices of a same
(local) network.

A bridge is a networking device, similar to a virtual switch, that connects two segments of a network.
In our configuration, it creates a link between the output of the host to VXLAN, through the router.

Broadcasting is sending data to every machines connected on a network. Multicasting means sending to 
designated machines.

The topology should allow communication between the two routers and their hosts. If host1 wants to send 
data to host2, it should work flawlessly.

EVPN (Ethernet Virtual Private Network) is an extension of BGP that allows for more global control over
the networks (hence, even more scalability). Instead of manually juggling with bridges and switches, it 
simplifies routing by considering MAC and IP addresses alike. It therefore sits at the junction of Layer 2
and Layer 3.

The Route Reflector is essentially used for large-scale networking. It is a component used by BGP to
improve routes distribution when many devices are added to the network. It consists in a router configured 
as a route reflector communicating with its leaves (routers joining the network), aka VTEPs.

VTEPs (VXLAN Tunnel Endpoints) describes the edges of a VXLAN where data is received, formatted and sent
to the VXLAN network. Routers can be configured to be VTEPs.

VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) is used to identify each VXLAN virtual network.  

A route of type 2 uses MAC addresses and is detected by the VTEP to which it is connected. The VTEP shares
the information with the rest of the network.
A route of type 3 uses IP addresses and is able to communicate with other routes connected with
a VTEP of a VXLAN network.
