GOAL: SIMULATE A SMALL DATACENTER USING BGP AND EVPN.

1. Create the topology

2. Launch the machines and open the auxiliary terminals

3. Configure the route reflector:
    - assign an IP address to enable communication with our VTEPs through their respective eths
    - assign a loopback address as an identifier inside the network
    - activate a BGP session and create a peer group
    - configure EVPN: set neighbors as clients (of the route reflector)
    - configure OSPF: add all the router's interfaces to an OSPF domain

4. Configure the routers: 
    - create a VXLAN group and a bridge
    - assign an IP address to enable communication with RR
    - assign a loopback address as an identifier inside the network
    - configure OSPF: add all the router's interfaces to an OSPF domain
    - define router as neighbor with corresponding id
    - activate EVPN
    - activate OSPF

5. Configure hosts:
    - assign IP address to enable communication with VTEPs
